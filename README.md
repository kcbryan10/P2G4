# <Studious>
## Description
- what we made was a fully functional application that allows student and teacher to connect and schedule lessons
- why we wanted to make this app in paticular is because there didnt seem to be any sights there where a "one stop shop" for student teacher scheduling
- how we acomplished this is using the knowledge and tools we learned throughout our time in the KU coding course so far.
- we learned alot about commincation between memeber (cordination), aswell as researching and applying new packages/ technologies
- [DEPLOYED ](https://protected-dusk-79081.herokuapp.com/) application. 
- [GITHUB](https://github.com/kcbryan10/Studious) page for the application.
